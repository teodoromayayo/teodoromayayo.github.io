<div class="post-description">
  <p>
This website mainly aims to provide notes on ordinary differential equations and ecological modeling. It is intended as a resource for students and anyone interested in gaining insight into these fields. Although I would love to write the notes in Catalan, my native language, I believe that using English will allow them to reach and benefit more people. However, I plan to upload material in Catalan in the near future.
