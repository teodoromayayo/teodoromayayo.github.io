Hey there! I am a second year PhD student in Mathematics at Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, working under the supervision of [Joan Toregrosa](https://www.gsd.uab.cat/people?controller=member&view=member&id=7) and [Josep Sardanyés](https://sites.google.com/site/nonlineardynamicsevolutionlab/home?authuser=0). My research focuses on the intersection of qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations and Ecology. In particular, I am interested on low-dimensional systems, where explainability and the richness of bifurcating phenomena prevail even under simple assumptions in models. 

Before my transition into mathematics, I studied Biomedical Engineering and pursued a Bachelor's degree in Economics, which I left during the final year. I later moved into applied mathematics by enrolling in a Master's program in Mathematical Modelling.

I earned a Master’s degree in Mathematical Modelling from Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB) in June 2023, where I completed my master’s thesis under the supervision of [Josep Sardanyés](https://sites.google.com/site/nonlineardynamicsevolutionlab/home?authuser=0) and [Núria Fagella]((https://webgrec.ub.edu/webpages/000006/cas/nfagella.ub.edu.html)). My work focused on the dynamics of elementary cellular automata (ECA), exploring approaches to classify their behavior despite the intrinsic undecidability of the problem.

I then completed a second Master’s degree in Mathematics at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) in May 2024, with a focus on Dynamical Systems and applications to Celestial Mechanics, while doing the PhD. I conducted my master’s thesis under the supervision of [Inma Baldomà](https://mat.upc.edu/en/people/immaculada.baldoma) and [Joan Toregrosa](https://www.gsd.uab.cat/people?controller=member&view=member&id=7), studying local codimension-1 bifurcations in planar Filippov systems.

Currently, I am teaching a course on Environmental Modelling.
