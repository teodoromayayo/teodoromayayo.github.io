Hey there! I am a PhD student in Mathematics at Universitat Autònoma de Catalunya, working under the supervision of [Joan Toregrosa](https://www.gsd.uab.cat/people?controller=member&view=member&id=7) and [Josep Sardanyés](https://sites.google.com/site/nonlineardynamicsevolutionlab/home?authuser=0). My research focuses on the intersection of qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations and Ecology. In particular, I am interested on low-dimensional systems, where explainability and the richness of bifurcating phenomena prevail even under simple assumptions in models.
